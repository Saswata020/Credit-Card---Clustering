# Credit-Card---Clustering
Credit Card is among a big business for any Bank. Issuing a Credit card not only a Brand awareness strategy but a revenue-generating exercise too. A credit card gives users an extra income to meet their needs which they can repay by next month to the bank without paying interest.

For banks across the world, credit cards are a significant source of revenue.
Credit card providers usually target users using their behavior and demographic information. Behaviors are often based on credit reports on how a person spends and pays over time.
Customer segmentation is the technique of separating a customer base into particular groups of persons. 
I took the data online which has 8950 rows and 17  predictor variables such as cash advance, credit limt, balance,purchase transaction, installments, full mayment etc.., 
As part of the exploratory data analysis phase, I took care of the outliers , numerical features were normalized(standard scalar). 

As part of segmenting the customers on the basis of their behaviour, I used K-means clustering algorithm and segmented them into 3 clusters.
